# rsynced from a real Pi; cmake/FindSDL2.cmake papers over its missing SDL headers with borrowed ones), or a
# Debian host with crossbuild-essential-armhf and the multiarch libsdl2*-dev:armhf packages (the Docker
# image). Separate from the PSC's own toolchain (toolchains/psc/PSCtoolchainV8.cmake) - see CLAUDE.md.
