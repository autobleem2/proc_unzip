# Minimal SDL2 discovery for the Raspberry Pi cross toolchain (toolchains/rpi/RPitoolchain.cmake).
#
# The sysGCC Raspberry Pi toolchain's sysroot was rsynced from a real Pi's installed *packages*, which
# gives us the SDL2/SDL2_image/SDL2_mixer/SDL2_ttf runtime .so files but no libsdl2-dev headers, no
# unversioned .so symlinks and no sdl2-config.cmake. lib_ableem/CMakeLists.txt's non-MinGW branch does one
# find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED) and then links the bare names SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf, so this
# single module defines all four as IMPORTED targets: headers from toolchains/rpi/sdl2-devkit (borrowed from
# the MSYS2 SDL2 package - the public headers are pure C, arch-independent, and close enough in version to
# the target .so's SONAME to be ABI-safe), libraries pointed straight at the sysroot's versioned .so files
# (no unversioned symlink needed since IMPORTED_LOCATION takes a full path).
