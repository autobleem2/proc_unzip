# Cross-compile AutoBleem for the PlayStation Classic with Sony's armv8-sony-linux-gnueabihf toolchain
# (crosstool-NG, GCC 8.2.0) - the real target. The same shape as pcsx-ab's toolchains/psc/PSCtoolchainV8.cmake,
# so the two projects build side by side on the same server.
#
# The toolchain root is AB_PSC_TOOLCHAIN (default /opt/toolchain, the crosstool-NG layout on the build server:
# <root>/bin/armv8-sony-linux-gnueabihf-gcc, <root>/armv8-sony-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot). The sysroot has the
# SDL2/SDL2_image/SDL2_mixer/SDL2_ttf dev files the console build needs (2.0.4, predating sdl2-config.cmake -
# hence cmake/FindSDL2.cmake next to this file). ./make_psc.sh runs this on the server over ssh; the toolchain
# is not installed on the Windows host.
