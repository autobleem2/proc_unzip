# Cross-compile AutoBleem for Windows from a Linux host with mingw-w64 - the Docker image (docker/Dockerfile's
# mingw stage) and the CI. The native Windows build on the PC is make_win.sh in MSYS2 and needs no toolchain
# file; this one exists so the same tree builds the same exe on a Linux CI runner.
#
# The compilers are Debian's x86_64-w64-mingw32-*-posix (the posix threads variant: the scan runs on a
# std::thread). SDL2 and SDL2_image/mixer/ttf are the official "devel-mingw" packages installed under
# AB_MINGW_SDL2 (/opt/mingw-sdl2 in the image: include/, lib/, lib/pkgconfig/, bin/*.dll); lib_ableem's
# MinGW branch finds them through pkg-config, which is pointed at that pkgconfig directory here.
