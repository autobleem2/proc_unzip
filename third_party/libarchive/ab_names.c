/*
 * proc_unzip: every name libarchive hands back in UTF-8, whatever the locale.
 *
 * libarchive converts an entry's name (UTF-16 in a 7z, UTF-16 or OEM in a RAR4) to "the current locale"'s
 * character set. The console has no locales at all - it runs in "C", which is ASCII - and this build has no
 * iconv, so every non-ASCII name would come back as '?'. Telling the archive object that its current
 * character set is UTF-8 makes libarchive take its own built-in UTF-16 -> UTF-8 route instead, on every
 * platform: archive_entry_pathname() is then UTF-8 (on Windows, archive_entry_pathname_utf8() is). Must be
 * called before the first archive_read_next_header().
